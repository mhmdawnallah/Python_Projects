# Python A-Z: Python for Data Science with Real Exercises

ğŸš€ Scalar Quantities: Completely descriped by their mangitude (Amount or size)
ğŸš€ Vector Quantities: Completely descriped by their Mangitude, and Direction
ğŸš€ Vector:
   initial point
   terminal point
   distance between initial point, terminal point is called Magnitude
ğŸš€ Scalar languages In scalar languages such as C and Pascal, operations apply only to single values,
ğŸš€ Reconsolidation of Different Types of Programming Languages:
    High Level:
      Object Oriented:
         Program is written as `an interaction of function between object`
         Bottom up Approach (More focus on Data)
      Procedural:
         Program is written as `sequences of instructions`
         Top Down Approach (More focus on functions)
    Low Level:
      Assembly Language
      Maching Language  
ğŸš€ Vectorized Programming Language vs Non-Vectorized Programming Language
ğŸš€ Python is a Non-Vectorized Programming Languages
ğŸš€ R is a Vectorized Programming Language
ğŸš€ Vectorized Programming allows you to focus more on aggregation the entire set of data instead of having to resort to explicit loops of individual scalar operations.
ğŸš€ Vectorized programing languages (or array programming languages, vector based programming languge or multidimensional    languages) generalize operations on scalars to apply transparently to vectors, matrices, and higher-dimensional arrays. The fundamental idea behind array programming is `that operations apply at once to an entire set of values.` This makes it a high-level programming model as it allows the programmer to think and operate on whole aggregates of data, without having to resort to explicit loops of individual scalar operations.

For example, numpy arrays are vectorized and lists are not.

# example using lists
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [2, 2, 2]
list1 * list2
>> TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'list'
# example using arrays
import numpy as np
array1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
array2 = np.array([2, 2, 2])
array1 * array2
>> array([2, 4, 6])
