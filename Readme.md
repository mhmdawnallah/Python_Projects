# Python A-Z: Python for Data Science with Real Exercises

ğŸš€ Scalar Quantities: Completely descriped by their mangitude (Amount or size)
ğŸš€ Vector Quantities: Completely descriped by their `Mangitude, and Direction`
ğŸš€ Vector:
   `initial point`
   `terminal point`
   `distance between initial point, terminal point is called Magnitude`
ğŸš€ Scalar languages In scalar languages such as C and Pascal, operations` apply only to single values,`
ğŸš€ Reconsolidation of Different Types of Programming Languages:
    High Level:
      Object Oriented:
         Program is written as `an interaction of function between object`
         Bottom up Approach (More focus on Data)
      Procedural:
         Program is written as `sequences of instructions`
         Top Down Approach (More focus on functions)
    Low Level:
      Assembly Language
      Maching Language  
ğŸš€ Vectorized Programming Language vs Non-Vectorized Programming Language
ğŸš€ Python is a Non-Vectorized Programming Languages
ğŸš€ R is a Vectorized Programming Language
ğŸš€ Vectorized Programming allows you to focus more on aggregation the entire set of data instead of having to resort to explicit loops of individual scalar operations.
ğŸš€ Vectorized programing languages (or array programming languages, vector based programming languge or multidimensional    languages) generalize operations on scalars to apply transparently to vectors, matrices, and higher-dimensional arrays. The fundamental idea behind array programming is `that operations apply at once to an entire set of values.` This makes it a high-level programming model as it allows the programmer to think and operate on whole aggregates of data, without having to resort to explicit loops of individual scalar operations.

For example, numpy arrays are vectorized and lists are not.

# example using lists
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = [2, 2, 2]
list1 * list2
>> TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'list'
# example using arrays
import numpy as np
array1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
array2 = np.array([2, 2, 2])
array1 * array2
>> array([2, 4, 6])
ğŸš€ None In Python is Equal to Null in Other Programming Languages
ğŸš€ Nested Statemetns are not the same as Chained Statements 
ğŸš€ Coding Indentation in Python
ğŸš€ random is a module into numpy which function randn() is part of it
ğŸš€ Reconsolidation of Mean / Expected value
ğŸš€ Converting Frequency Distribution Table -< Probability Distribution Table
ğŸš€ Law of Large Numbers:
   n (Number of elements in sample) -< Infinity
   then mean of sample values go nearer, and nearer to population mean (Expected Value)
   The more elements are, the more we go from experimental probabilities to Theoratical Probabilities
ğŸš€ Slicing in Python === Subsetting
ğŸš€ Positive Indexation or Negative Indexation In Indexing
ğŸš€ Python Packages:
    - Find Package
    - Install Package
    - Import Package | Function

ğŸš€ If you want to create a second a window for the terminal while you're running the first winodw
   for anaconda, Run Command+T
ğŸš€ Just see this Imageâ€¦â€¦.We understand that Package contains a collection of modules and a module contains a collection of Functions.
Thus, we can say Functions are the subset of modules and Modules are the subset of Packages.
ğŸš€ There are two types of array in python:
       - There are arrays that're built in core of Python
       - There are also Numpy Arrays
ğŸš€ Numpy Array protects computer memory (e.g: not creating copy of array when slicing happens)
ğŸš€ Matrix Population:
    in Python Like C- Programming Language (Rows Populated First)
    in R Like Fortran Programming Langauge (Columns Populated First)
ğŸš€ Supress Warnings in Python, Jupyter Notebook through warnings Module
